    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>A few ideas to keep in mind for a dinner that’ll tickle the taste buds.

        <p>- Meat: You can use a combination of beef and pork for this recipe. Using pork add extra fat which will give a moist tender meatball. You can also use ground turkey, chicken or combination of meats.</p>
        <p>- Spices: The nutmeg and allspice are unique to this swedish dish. Don’t leave them out if you want truly divine fare. </p>
        <p>- Overmixing:  Be Careful to not overmix the meat mixture or it can become tough.</p>
        <p>- No Bread crumbs:  You can get the same result by making a panade (bread and milk mixture) Use two pieces of bread and process till crumbs, add in ¼ cup milk to create a paste. Add the egg and mix. Add to your meat mixture.</p>
        <p>- Saute: For softer sweeter flavor to your onions saute them first.</p>
        <p>- Bake: Brown the meatballs in the skillet in oil and butter. Then remove to a baking tray and finish cooking in the oven at 350 degrees F. till done. There shouldn’t be any pink.
        <p>- Cream: Do not substitute out the heavy cream for half and half, it could separate. You can also cut some of the cream for sour cream for a nice tang to the sauce.
