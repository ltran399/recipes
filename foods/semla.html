            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
            <li>Make the dough by melting the butter in a small saucepan. Add the milk and test to make sure the liquid is lukewarm and not too hot to the touch. If it is too hot to touch, let it cool off until it is about 100°F.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid, scraping out any solidified butter if your kitchen is cold, into the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the egg, cardamom, salt and stir to break up the egg, dissolve the salt and distribute the cardamom. Add the flour and sugar. Stir until most of the flour has been absorbed, then switch to the dough hook attachment. Knead and mix the dough on medium low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly spray a large bowl with cooking oil, then gather the dough into a smooth ball. Place the ball of dough down into the bowl, making sure the “rough” side of the dough is face down in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest to rise for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking sheets.
                Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (if you have a scale, each piece should be about 85 to 90 g). Roll the dough into rough balls and then place them on the lined baking sheet, 6 buns per baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Beat together the egg yolk and cream. Brush this egg wash over the top of each dough round. Bake the buns for 14 to 16 minutes or until the top of the bun is golden brown. If you have an instant read thermometer, the inside of the bun should register 180°F to 190°F.</li>
            <li>Once the buns are cool, cut into the bun, in a diagonal downward motion, making an inverted cone or pyramid to cut out the center bun. Then cut the inside center off the top of the bun. Set aside the inside of the bread.</li>
            <li>Make the filling placing the almond meal/flour and sugar in a blender or food processor along with inside of the bread rolls. Pulse a few times to break down the bread into crumbs and blend the almond and sugar. Drizzle the milk and almond extract (if using) into the blender or food processor until a paste forms.</li>
            <li>Make the whipped cream by placing the heavy cream and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment. Whip the cream together until soft peaks form. Fill a pastry bag fitted with large tip with the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Spoon a tablespoon of the almond paste into the bottom of the bun, then top with a swirl of whipped cream. Place the top of the bun over the whipped cream. Dust with powdered sugar. Repeat with the remaining buns and serve immediately.</li>
